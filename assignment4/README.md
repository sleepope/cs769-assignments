# Assignment 4 (Course project)

## Logistics
The class project will be carried out in groups of 2 or 3 people. Please actively search your teammate either posting a note on piazza or chatting after class. The deadline of Assignment 3 is **5/10** 11:59PM (We extend the deadline from 5/6 to 5/10). Every team has 3 late days in total for Assignment 3 and 4.

## Submission Information
In **Homework Assignment 4**, you should also turn in a report that provides an overview of your idea and also contains a brief survey of related work on the topic. Please submit the following the report to [Canvas](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/292771/assignments).


- **a report**: This should be named "report.pdf" in the top directory. This is for assignments 4, and can be **up to 9 pages for assignment 4**. References are not included in the page count, and it is OK to submit appendices that include supplementary information such as hyperparameter settings or additional output examples, although there is no guarantee that the TAs will read them. Submissions that exceed the page count will be penalized one third grade (33%) for each page over. The report must use the official ACL style templates, which are available from [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to *ACL* conferences available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). The proposal report should include the following information:

    - Project title and list of group members.
    - Introduction about the research topic, including the motivation of your work, brief comparision with prior work, and contributions of this report. This should be approximately 1-1.5 pages long.
    - A short literature survey of 4 or more relevant papers. The literature review should take up approximately 0.5-1 page.
    - Description of your proposed methods beyond the existing work. For reports focusing on data curation, this section should describe the detailed steps for the dataset/annotation collection. This should be approximately 1.5-2 pages long.
    - Description of your experimental settings, including the datasets you used, the methods/models in comparison, the hyperparameters used for all methods, and any preprocessing steps you did for the datasets.
    - Detailed experimental results and fine-grained analysis. This should be approximately 2 pages long.
    - Conclusion and discussion about the strengths and limitations of your work, and highlight potential future directions. This should be approximately 0.5 page long.
    - Detailed contribution of the group members. This should be approximately 0.5 page long.

## Grading
The course project takes up 30% of your final grading.
- Report (10%)
- Code (10%)
- Presentation (10%)

The grading breakdown for the report is as follows:
- 15% for clear description of the introduction and motivation
- 25% for clear and concise description of proposed method
- 25% for literature survey that covers at least 4 relevant papers
- 25% for the experimental settings and analysis.
- 10% for quality of writing

The grading breakdown for the code is as follows:
- 100: The code is well-organized, including all experiment scripts (e.g., bash scripts, python files). All experimental results can be easily reproduciable without errors. Detailed instructions on the readme are provided. Every team member contributes roughly the same amounts of efforts to the repository.
- 95: Most (>80%) experiment scripts are included. Experiments can be reproduced with some efforts. Instructions on at least 80% of the experiments are provided. All team member contributes to the repository.
- 90: Some (50%) key experiment scripts are included. At least half of the experiments can be reproduced. Instructions on at least 50% of the experiments are provided. Most team member contributes to the repository.
- 85: Parts of the key experiment scripts are missing. 30% of the experiments can be reproduced. Instructions are largely missing. Only 2 team members contribute to the repository.
- 80: Many key experiment scripts are missing. It's not easiy to reproduce the experiments. Instructions are missing. Only one member contributes to the repository.

Each team will have 8mins for the presentation (6mins talk & 2mins QA). The grading breakdown for the presentation is as follows:
Please sign up the presentation slots using this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tBFH2NJc_0FpMrtg1iYR4VX9OB9fvQ_zI4GmURAiovw/edit?usp=sharing). 
- 15% for the clear description about the task, and the motivation of your work.
- 25% for the concise summary of the existing works.
- 25% for the clear description of proposed method (with animation if possible).
- 25% for the experimental results and analysis.
- 10% for the QA.
